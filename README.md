<b>SPACE CONCORDIA WEBSITE</b>

Guidelines to add sponsors to the website:

<ol>
<li>Sponsor images are located at img/sponsors/xx-xx (xx-xx being the years).
   Please place them in the corresponding years to keep things neat and easy to find.</li>

<li>Images are generally saved as a .jpg using the Save for Web option in Photoshop in order to have the images load faster</li>

<li>Image sizes are as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>Platinum: 350x350</li>
	<li>Gold: 250x250</li>
	<li>Silver: 170x170</li>
	<li>Bronze: 100x100</li>
	</ul></li>

<li>Here is the format for each individual sponsor:<br>
<code><div class="col-lg-4"><br>
      <a href="http://mdacorporation.com/"><img class="img" src="img/sponsors/15-16/mda.jpg" alt="MDA" width="350" height="350"></a><br>
      <h2>MDA</h2><br>
  </div></code>
</li>
</ol>
