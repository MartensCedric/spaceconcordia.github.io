<b>SPACE CONCORDIA WEBSITE</b>

Guidelines to add sponsors to the website:

1) Sponsor images are located at img/sponsors/xx-xx (xx-xx being the years).
   Please place them in the corresponding years to keep things neat and easy to find.

2) Images are generally saved as a .jpg using the Save for Web option in Photoshop in order to have the images load faster

3) Image sizes are as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>Platinum: 350x350</li>
	<li>Gold: 250x250</li>
	<li>Silver: 170x170</li>
	<li>Bronze: 100x100</li>
	</ul>
